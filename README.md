# JavaScript Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a random secure password. I wanted users to be able to use this application to generate a secure password that they can use whenever they want to have a strong password for accounts that they create on other sites.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can see this application in action by clicking the link here: https://shaneleejohnson.github.io/JavaScript-Password-Generator/

To use the password generator, click the Generate Password button. You will be prompted to select a password length between 8 and 128 characters. You will then be asked what type of characters you would like to include in the password. You can choose uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or symbols but must choose at least one type. After making all of your selections a unique password will be generated in the text area and you can copy and paste it to a word file, or directly to where you are being asked to create a password.

The following screenshot shows what the application should look like after a password is generated.
